            <h2>High School</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                In high school I competed with students from schools all across the state for the title of Sterling Scholar.
                Out of hundreds of very talented students, I had the honor of taking first place in the Computer Technology
                category.

                In my first year of high school, I competed in the Central Utah Science & Engineering Fair (CUSEF) by
                submitting a project that my long-time friend and I had worked on since the beginning of middle school.
                We created MinecraftK12, an educational platform that turned Minecraft into a teaching tool.
                Our project won first place and awards from Intel and BYU.
